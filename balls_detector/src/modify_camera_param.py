We modify the camera parameters, in particular we set exposure to manual mode,
we reduce exposure to a minimum value, and we turn of autofocus

Reducing exposure allows for the elimination of the objects that are not bright
and allows for better detection of the robots
Turning off autofocus reduces distortion in image and detection that arise from
the camera trying to focus continuously
